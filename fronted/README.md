# Odoo - Accounting/ERP System - Frontend

This document provides a detailed explanation of the frontend for the Odoo - Accounting/ERP System project.

**Note:** The frontend source code was not fully available, so this description is based on the backend API and general application structure.

## Frontend Logic

The frontend is a Next.js application that provides a user interface for the accounting and ERP system.

- **Dashboard**: A dashboard to provide an overview of the business, including key metrics like total sales, purchases, and payments.
- **Modules**: The frontend is likely organized into modules that correspond to the backend functionalities:
  - **Contacts**: A module for managing customers and vendors.
  - **Products**: A module for managing products and services.
  - **Purchases**: A module for creating and managing purchase orders and vendor bills.
  - **Sales**: A module for creating and managing sales orders and customer invoices.
  - **Accounting**: A module for managing the chart of accounts, general ledger, and financial reports.
- **API Interaction**: The frontend heavily interacts with the backend API to perform all its operations. This includes:
  - Authenticating users.
  - Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all the different modules.
  - Fetching data for financial reports.

## UI Components

Based on the backend API, the frontend likely contains the following UI components:

- **Tables**: To display lists of contacts, products, orders, invoices, etc.
- **Forms**: To create and edit contacts, products, orders, invoices, etc.
- **Charts**: To visualize financial data in the dashboard and reports.
- **Navigation**: A sidebar or top navigation bar to switch between the different modules.
